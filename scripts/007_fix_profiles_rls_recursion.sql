-- Fix infinite recursion in profiles RLS policies
-- The issue is that policies query profiles table to check roles, creating circular dependency

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company admins can view company profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company admins can manage company profiles" ON profiles;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies for profiles
-- Policy 1: Users can always view and update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can access their own profile" ON profiles
    FOR ALL USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 2: Allow INSERT for new user registration (needed for sign up)
CREATE POLICY "Allow profile creation" ON profiles

-- For company-wide access, we'll handle this in the application layer
-- rather than in RLS policies to avoid recursion
